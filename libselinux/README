NOTE:

	The ports - libselinux and libsepol are only here as an
	assistant program for some AppImages that may require 
	selinux's libraries.

	This is NOT a full implementation of Selinux.

	If you wish to use these libraries, you should create
	the configuration file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opt.conf with
	the two lines that point to your libs directories in
	/opt. A typical example are the two following lines.
	
	/opt/lib/
	/opt/usr/lib/
