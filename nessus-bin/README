NOTE:

    For the first time start the 'nessusd' daemon then stop it. This will 
    install the appropriate files. The Nessus' configuration file is located at
    /opt/nessus/etc/nessus/nessusd.conf it is recommended you configure this 
    by copying nessusd.conf.imported to nessusd.conf and then edit the file.

    You will also need to add a user. 'sudo nessuscli adduser [username]'.

    Once configured and a user has been added you can lauch the nessus daemon
    'nessusd' and be able to access it via 'https://<ip>:<port>'. The default
    for example would be 'https://127.0.0.1:8834'

    By default nessus installs two certificates:

    /opt/nessus/com/nessus/CA/servercert.pem
    /opt/nessus/var/nessus/CA/serverkey.pem

    To remove any SSL warnings these files must be replaced with certificate 
    files generated by your organization or a trusted certificate authority 
    (CA). Before replacing the certificate files, stop the Nessus server. 
    Replace the two files and restart the Nessus server.
