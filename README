These are the unmaintained ports from my CRUX ports collection.

This is also a working repository. If you wish to add it then download the 
unmaintained.httpup to '/etc/ports/' and edit the '/etc/prt-get.conf' file. You
can do this by adding the line 'prtdir /usr/ports/yenjie/unmaintained' and then 
to update just 'ports -u unmaintained'. If you do not wish and only want
specific ports then you can download them separately instead. This is the
recommended way.

This only exists for the benefit of those who wish to get ideas from the
Pkgfile or any patches and scripts that may come in handy.
