NOTE:

  This is experimental and by no means ready. To make this script useful 
  I suggest you edit /etc/rc.modules and add the following lines before
  /sbin/depmod -a.

    if [ -f /sbin/modautocompile.sh ]; then
      /bin/bash /sbin/modautocompile.sh start
    fi

  I haven't even tested it yet.
